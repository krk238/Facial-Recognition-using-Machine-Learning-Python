# Facial-Recognition-using-Machine-Learning-Python
This application allows for the recognition of people's faces in pictures, videos or through the webcam of the computer the application is running on.
It can be pre-configured to recognize faces in a video, live webcam capture, or image through the calling of either the picture_Face_Detector or webcam_Face_Detector functions. It utilizes the haar cascade algorithm and openCV library to implement haar features to recognize facial features. 
This application is simple in concept and practice; yet it is currently being further worked on to be used for other purposes, such as an facial image capturer or a face blurer.
